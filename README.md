# Smart Car Parking System
This project is an ultrasonic car parking system designed to detect car entries and exits in a small parking space (up to 3 cars). It uses ultrasonic sensors, a servo motor for barrier control, and LEDs for visual feedback.

## Features
- Detects car entry and exit using ultrasonic sensors.
- Controls barrier movement with a servo motor.
- Provides visual feedback on parking availability using LEDs.

## Hardware Used
- Microcontroller (ESP8266)
- Ultrasonic sensors (x2)
- Servo motor
- LEDs
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard 

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE
